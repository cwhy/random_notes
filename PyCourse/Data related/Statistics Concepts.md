From event to number
$X$
$P(X)$

### Discrete Random Variable
Map event to an integer
### Continuous Random Variable
Map event to an real number

### Examples
- Continuous (Exponential Family)
	- Beta -> Uniform
	- Gamma -> Exponential
	- Gaussian(Normal)
- Discrete
	- Uniform
	- Binomial
	- Geometric
